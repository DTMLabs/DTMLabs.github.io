My intention is to help myself learn through the

I don't claim to be an expert in anything~

** Many people dislike math

*** Some people dislike math because they thought they were bad at it.

*** I use to struggle with math, until I learned to program.

** Lisp is a very interesting way to program



** Lisp provides an interesting way to do mathematics.



** Dialects of Lisp

* TODO Writing Resumes for neurodivergent folk                  :ADHD:Autism:

** Writing a resume is hard

** ND folk often have a hard time finding work

** So what?

*** A good resume is your key to a good job
** Executive Summaries are your chance to stand out

** Have someone trusted double check for errors

** Apply for any job that interests you

** Try to keep to two pages or less

** Add hidden text to the resume for SEO

** Put your most impressive stuff first, then the stuff you're less confident on
